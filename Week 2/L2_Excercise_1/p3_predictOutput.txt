-------The Snippet of Code--------------

#include <stdio.h> 
#include <stdbool.h> 
 
int main() { 
    bool isPassed = true; 
    printf("Result: %d", isPassed); 
    return 0; 
} 
 

 What will be the output of the following code snippet? 

-----------‚ùìMy Answer:-----------------

The output from the snippet above , once compiled into an exe file, will be 1, since we specified that
the variable type was an integer as per our pointer %d which stands for "digit"/integer

The 1 here represents the value true. 

If isPassed were equal to false, the output would be 0 

In binary, 1 is true and 0 is false, thus when representing a boolean value in integers, 
the output is always going to be 0 or 1 for false and true.
