�Q1. What is the difference between a function declaration and a 
function definition in C? 
-> Declaration: Tells the compiler the function’s name, return type, and parameters.

-> Definition: Includes the actual body of the function with logic.


�Q2. Why is comparing arrays directly with == invalid in C, and what is 
the alternative? 
 
In C, == only checks to see if the 2 compared values share the same memory location, 
not if they are the same contents. A simple alternative would be to iterate through 
each of the elements in the array and check if they match. 

�Q3. Explain why 5 / 2 gives 2 in C but 2.5 in Python. 
 
5 / 2 in C performs integer division, result = 2.

In Python, / performs float division, result = 2.5.

�Q4. How does passing by value in C affect functions that modify 
variables? 
When passing by value, changes made in the function do not reflect back on the original variables



�Q5. What would happen if a float is passed to a function expecting 

an int? 
The float is truncated to an int — decimal part lost.
